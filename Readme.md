# Getting started

## PHP

Install PHP and serve the files from the `php` folder with a local server.

## ReactJs / NextJs

Install NodeJs, install the dependencies, then build the project.
The start command is intentionally a build + preview to show the production version without being affected by development tools.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
